# Virtual Memory Manager and Pager

Designed and implemented a Virtual Memory Manager (VMM) that maps virtual addresses to physical memory. Developed a pager to handle page swapping between RAM and disk, integrating Copy-on-Write (CoW) for memory optimization. Enhanced pager algorithms to prevent thrashing and maintain performance under heavy load.
