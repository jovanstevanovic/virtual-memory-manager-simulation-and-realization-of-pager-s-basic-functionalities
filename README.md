# Virtual Memory Manager and Pager

Virtual Memory Manager (VMM):
I've designed and implemented a Virtual Memory Manager. This component handles memory by abstracting a larger virtual
memory space for processes compared to the available physical RAM. It facilitates the mapping of virtual addresses to
physical memory or disk storage, enabling seamless concurrent execution of processes and enhancing overall system
performance.

Pager with Copy-on-Write (CоW) Technique:
A pager is responsible for determining which pages to swap between RAM and disk. In my implementation of the pager, I've
integrated the Copy-on-Write (CоW) technique as well. This technique optimizes memory efficiency by allowing multiple
processes to share the same memory until modification is necessary. At that point, I ensure a separate copy is created,
minimizing redundancy and enhancing the system's efficiency.

Thrashing Protection:
I've incorporated thrashing protection mechanisms to safeguard against performance deterioration due to excessive
paging. My approach involves optimizing pager algorithms. By implementing thrashing protection strategies, I've ensured
that my system remains responsive and efficient, even under high-demand scenarios.
